Ever wanted to make 3DS Homebrew apps without excessive use of middle level language (C/C++)? Well this library is for you!!!
</p>

Also a revival of the deleted repo named ***3DSHaxe*** by [MochaIcedTea](https://github.com/MochaIcedTea), now continued with more stuff coming it's way! If i do it.

## News! This library now has a discord server!

# How does it work?

This make uses of [reflaxe](https://github.com/SomeRanDev/reflaxe) and [reflaxe.cpp](https://github.com/SomeRanDev/reflaxe.CPP) which can read and compile haxe code to c++ outputted code so that the compiler can understand and compile to 3dsx! This was done with lots of love (and rage) to make this program so i hope i can get some support.

Note: Tested **ONLY** on Haxe 4.3.2, I'm not planning to support Haxe 5+ and never will.
