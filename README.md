### Haxe3DS - Compile Haxe code to 3DS

truly inspired from [HaxeCompileU](https://github.com/Slushi-Github/hxCompileU) and [DSHaxe](https://github.com/MochaIcedTea/DSHaxe)

# THIS IS A WIP, NOT EVERYTHING IS IMPLEMENTED
### maybe will become a haxelib in some day idk

#### usage:

1. install [devkitpro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)
2. download or git clone this repo
3. (will go unused soon) launch cmd and type "build -c" it will compile to working code
4. get the funny results

# note:

reflaxe.cpp and reflaxe library is kept cause it's only the specific version that currently works

that's all yeah it's boring

## KNOWN BUGS:

building in cia pops up the ROMFS Error
